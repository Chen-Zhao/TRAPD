Finding novel Mendelian disease genes can often be challenging. While some disorders are amenable to family-based analyses (e.g., linkage or segregation), others may be very challenging for a number of reasons. One approach is to use burden testing, where the aggregate burden of rare protein-altering variants in each gene is tested against a set of controls. While one may use a set of available control sequencing data, this is generally too expensive and unavailable in most circumstances. Here, we provide a simple-to-use program that allows for burden testing against publicly available summary level data (e.g., ExAC or gnomAD).
